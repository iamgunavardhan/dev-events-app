# Dev Events

This is a full-stack event discovery platform built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. It allows developers to browse upcoming tech events, create new events, and book participation through a simple and modern interface.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the app by modifying files inside the `app/` directory. The project uses the Next.js App Router, so pages update automatically as you modify them.

## Features

- Browse featured developer events
- Book events with email validation
- Duplicate booking protection
- Built with React Server Components
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root and add:
